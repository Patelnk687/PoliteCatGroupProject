## Spin-Off/Remix Concepts:
 
 - we could do like a profile so users can create lists of their favorite games
 
         
        

## Todo
 - Make a list of Favorite Games, User Profile
- Views:
  + Profile form
     - username
     - password
     - email
  + Profile Page
      - username
      - profile pic (give users a selection instead of upload? emojis?)
      - list of favorite video games id- vidGame
      - list of favorite board games id- boardGame
      - list of favorite card games id- cardGame
- Profile route
